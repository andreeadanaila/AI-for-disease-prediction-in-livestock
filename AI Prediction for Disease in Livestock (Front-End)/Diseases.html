                <h5>Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)</h5>
                <p>is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. It typically begins with a high fever, followed by painful blisters on the mouth and feet, leading to lameness and reluctance to move. Although the disease has a short duration—usually one to two weeks—its rapid spread and economic impact make early detection critical. While not usually fatal in adult animals, FMD can be deadly for young livestock. Vaccination and immediate containment are essential for controlling outbreaks.</p>

                <h5>Avian Influenza</h5>
                <p>Avian Influenza, also known as bird flu, is a severe viral infection that can spread quickly among poultry such as chickens, ducks, and turkeys. Common signs include coughing, nasal discharge, swelling of the head and neck, and in some cases, sudden death with no prior symptoms. This disease is of particular concern in densely populated poultry farms due to its high mortality rate. Although there is no specific treatment, outbreaks can be managed through quarantine, culling infected animals, and enforcing strict biosecurity measures.

                <h5>Bovine Tuberculosis (TB)</h5>
                <p> is a chronic bacterial disease that affects cattle, causing symptoms such as coughing, gradual weight loss, lethargy, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease progresses slowly, often going unnoticed until it becomes more advanced. Bovine TB poses a significant health risk not just to animals but also to humans, as it is a zoonotic disease. Control efforts focus on regular testing and the culling of infected animals, as treatment is rarely practical in livestock settings.</p>

                <h5>Parasitic Worm Infections</h5>
                <p>are among the most common health issues in livestock, especially in animals that graze on open pastures. These infections often lead to symptoms like diarrhea, visible weight loss, swollen bellies, and general weakness. Left untreated, worm infestations can stunt growth and reduce productivity. Fortunately, these infections are treatable with deworming medication, and regular preventative care is crucial to keeping animals healthy year-round.</p>

                <h5>Mastitis</h5>
                <p>is a common and economically significant disease that affects dairy animals, particularly cows. It is an inflammation of the mammary gland, usually caused by bacterial infection. The disease leads to swelling, redness, and pain in the udder, along with changes in milk appearance—such as clots, discoloration, or a decrease in milk yield. In more severe cases, animals may develop fever and show signs of systemic illness. Mastitis not only affects animal welfare but also results in substantial financial losses due to discarded milk and veterinary costs. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, but prevention through hygiene, proper milking practices, and regular udder checks remains the most effective approach. These are just a few examples of the diseases our system can help identify. Early recognition and response are key to maintaining healthy livestock, and our AI-based platform aims to assist farmers and veterinarians by offering timely, symptom-based predictions.</p>
